# User Instructions
Compilation of the given codes require Python 3.
# Codes and results
Download model weights and unzip them
Run the code S-EWSNet_trained.ipynb to load the model weights followed by testing on a given sample data "data1" undergoing critical transition. The code allows enterign your own sample data and testing on S-EWSNet.
